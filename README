Xournal is old and its age is showing. Unfortunately, it's effectively the only fully-fledged, maintained software available.

I have applied patches which add:
- bookmarks
- next/prev file in directory functionality
- autoscroll to last opened page
- go to next page with annotation

None of the code is mine and it was all applied from patches found on the xournal sourceforge page, linked below.
